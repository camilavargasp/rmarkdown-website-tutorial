Here I just want to try adding things in different formats to see some of the infinite possibilities in this platform.



## Add a table


Table 1: Number of siblings of OHI Fellows

Fellow        | N of siblings
------------- | -------------
Iwen          |    1
Ellie         |    2
Camila        |    4


##Color text

I relly wanted to try this... Love colors!

<font size="3" color="cyan4">This is awsome</font>

<font size="6" color="darkslateblue">I think you can see how exited I am</font>

<font size="3" color="deepskyblue2">Another cool color</font>
